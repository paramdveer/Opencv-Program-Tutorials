Image Arithmetic:
1>The Addtion and Substraction of the images
2> the Difference in the Addtion and substraction of open cv and numpy addition and Substraction
clipping>
    In Clipping there is a maximum value and a minumum value if during any operation substraction or addition the value
    falls outside of the boundaries it will take the minimum and maximum value go the boundaries
    ex limit of colors or uint8 are 0-256 so if we add cv2.add(np.uint8([200]),np.uint8([100]))==250
    cv2.subtract(np.uint8([100]),np.uint8([200]))==0
    the limit of uint is 0-255 so
    100+200=300 but as limit is 255 so output is 255
    200-100=-100 but as limit is 0 so output is 0
modulo arithmetic //â€œwraps around.
In Wrap around if we have a maximum and minimum value, if during any operatino substraction or addition the value
falls outside of the range it will wrap the values again within the boundaries
ex the limit of the colors or uint8 is 0-255 so id we add (np.uint8([200]) + np.uint8([100]))==44
(np.uint8([100]) + np.uint8([200]))=155
100+200=300 but here max=255 so after 255 again it starts from 0 so 45
200-100=-100 but here min is 0 so it wil count backwards from 255==155

To increase the brightness we can add pixels to the image
To decrease the brightness we can substract the pixels to the image
